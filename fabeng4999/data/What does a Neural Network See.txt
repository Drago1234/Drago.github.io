Hi Zhengqi,

I hope you and your family are safe in these difficult times. I have been telling everybody to use this time well. Sure, spend some time reading the news, but make sure you spend a lot more time building your skills. Time is the coin of your life and everybody gets the same 24 hours to spend.

Today we have an interesting post that contains an interesting bag of tricks every Deep Learning engineer should have.

Let's say you have trained a convolutional neural network for image classification.

A lot of times we think of image classification as a black box -- we input an image and out comes a class label ( e.g. cat, dog, camel etc.).

What part of the image did the neural network "see" to make the decision? A naive deep learning engineer has no idea!

This question becomes very important when you are trying to debug a network which is not giving the right results. It is also important when your application requires you to not only output a class label but also explain why a decision was made.

In today's post, we will explain how to answer this question.

AI Courses by OpenCV.org

AI Courses by OpenCV.org will open for enrollment until April 6. If you interested in a career in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and AI, these courses are a perfect start. We were planning to raise the price this time but decided against it because of the difficult times.

Please use the coupon code LEARN-AI-10 at checkout to receive a 10% discount. Here is link to enroll

That's all we wanted to cover in this email.

Cheers!
