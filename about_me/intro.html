    I love both robotic and computer science. I believe that there will be a huge demand in the next 20 years and future, and those skills and theoretical concept will become the backbone for the next wave of the technology revolution, and that's why I want to hone my skills in both fields. I have taken a lot of courses in various area of computer science, including Web Development, Information Security, Operating Systems, Networking, Natural Language Processing, AI/ML/DL, High-Performance Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Statistic Modeling and more (I am a more far-sighted person, and I believe it's advisable to broaden my view first before deciding where I should dig in!)

    Soaring tuition is placing higher education beyond the reach of average one, and I believe we should reduce the cost to access knowledge.(Based on my experience, for public school you need to prepare $50-60k for a year, and for private school, you are looking at something like $80k+. In terms of the <strong>Educational Quality</strong>, they are pretty equitable. So, you really don't need to get your foot into those ivy leagues school if you don't have that luxurious. For my opinion, those public school often have more resources than private school, and it's more cost-effective. Ranking isn't real important, but it does say something about a school, and here is how I read those numbers: Tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, tier 4 = 1-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-200). Getting back to POI(point of interest), if we are looking at the future, probably hundred year from now, we are going to experience a energy crisis. If you don't think so, there are some question you can ask for your self,(Hint: use data <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41433">here</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy">here</a> to complete the calculation!): How much energy do we need for the next 100 year? and how much energy can we produce each year? and how much we left as unexploited? <u>How can we use those energy to fullfill the demand for the next 100 years?</u> After some calculation, you might get shocked by the result.

    Imaging what a better world we will be live with if everyone is well educated? We can let go those cumbersome and repetitive physical work to robots and computers, and we, as human, as Homo sapiens, can focus more on control and planning, and other high level intelligent activities. Because of these, I am planning to open source all my course notes in my bachelor study and anything after. All the notes will soon to be publish on the Knowledge Bank, and here is example for the networking course, <a href="./Lecture_note_v3.htm">Networking_Course_Note.html</a>

  <!-- I am currently a senior-year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in <strong> Computer Science and Engineering</strong> (with Artificial Intelligence as my specialization) and a minor in Statistics. Before studying abroad at OSU, I obtained my high school degree from Foreign Language School Attached to
  Guangxi Normal University. <br><br> Particulary, my interests mainly focus on <strong> High-Perfromance Deep Learning, Object Detection, and Data Analysis</strong>. Besides that, I am actively seeking the opportunies to gain more hand-on experience about Robotic Control and SLAM. So far, I am proficient in spearking Chinese and English. -->
