    I am currently a senior-year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in <strong>
      Computer Science and Engineering</strong> (with Artificial Intelligence as my specialization) and a minor in
    Statistics. Before studying abroad at OSU, I obtained my high school degree from Foreign Language School Attached to
    Guangxi Normal University. <br><br>
    Particulary, my interests particularly focus on <strong> High-Perfromance Deep Learning, Object Detection, and Data
      Analysis</strong>. Besides that, I am actively seeking the opportunies to gain more hand-on experience about
    Robotic Control and SLAM. So far, I am proficient in spearking Chinese and English.

    <strong>Summary: </strong>In this project, we proposed a hybrid filtering movie recommendation system that combines
    the idea of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering and integrated the representation learned from
    multiple sources. While conducting the experiments, we explored the performance of text embedding methods by using
    it as our text-embedding module, and designed unique metapaths and a novel rating-aware sampling policy for graph
    embedding. Leveraging both text and graph contextual information, the system further improved the quality of
    recommendation system compared to methods using single information source.

    <strong>Abstract: </strong>Most traditional plant disease diagnosis strategies depend on human visual observation
    and inspection. However, this approach is time-consuming and requires significant human effort and expert knowledge.
    The recent advances in computer vision and deep learning provide a potential pathway to developing a plant disease
    diagnosis system that allows rapid detection of disease across large spatial areas with minimal human intervention.
    In this study, we developed a deep learning approach for plant leaf disease classification problems and conducted a
    range of experiments to quantify the performance of several state-of-the-art neural network architectures, including
    ResNet50, InceptionV3, and NASNet. All of the experiments were trained on the PlantVillage dataset with 54305 images
    in total, spanning over 38 plant disease classes. We evaluated four different performance metrics to assess each
    architecture: accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC). Our results showed that the InceptionV3
    neural network architecture outperformed all other Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures (ResNet50,
    NASNet-Large, NASNet-Mobile, MobileNet-v3-small, and MobileNet-v3-large) and produced a training accuracy of 94.14%
    and 97.94% over 6 epochs and 40 epochs of training, respectively. These results suggest that CNN architectures
    broadly, and the InceptionV3 model specifically, is capable of remote and automated plant disease detection. These
    results point to exciting future applications in lightweight mobile phone applications or backend workstation
    developments for plant leaf disease recognition problems.<a
