        I am currently a senior-year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in <strong> Computer Science and Engineering</strong> (with Artificial Intelligence as my specialization) and a minor in Statistics. Before studying abroad at OSU, I obtained my high school degree from Foreign Language School Attached to Guangxi Normal University. <br><br>
        Particulary, my interests particularly focus on <strong> High-Perfromance Deep Learning, Object Detection, and Data Analysis</strong>. Besides that, I am actively seeking the opportunies to gain more hand-on experience about Robotic Control and SLAM. So far, I am proficient in spearking Chinese and English.

        <strong>Summary: </strong>In this project, we proposed a hybrid filtering movie recommendation system that combines the idea of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering and integrated the representation learned from multiple sources. While conducting the experiments, we explored the performance of text embedding methods by using it as our text-embedding module, and designed unique metapaths and a novel rating-aware sampling policy for graph embedding. Leveraging both text and graph contextual information, the system further improved the quality of recommendation system compared to methods using single information source.

        <strong>Summary: </strong>In our study, the InceptionV3 deep learning architecture was tested to be the most suitable CNN model in applying to the image-based plant leaf disease recognition on the PlantVillage dataset. Throughout the study, we have conducted a comprehensive literature review on the past related research on the field of deep-learning based plant disease detection and provided a series of empirical experiments in applying the techniques, including tuning the performance by varying train-valid set split ratio, pre-trained CNN models, loss functions, and batch size. All the experiments conducted in our study were trained on the OSC Pitzer cluster with 48 cores of Dual NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs. The result of this study showed that the InceptionV3 neural network architecture outperformed all other candidates CNN models. Specifically, we demonstrated in the experimental section that the InceptionV3 can achieve top-1 accuracy of 94.14% in training and 94.53% in validation over 2-hour training and 97.94% in training and 96.04% in validation over 16-hours, respectively, which suggest that the InceptionV3 model is suitable for both light weight mobile applications and backend workstation purpose development within the context of plant leaf disease recognition.
