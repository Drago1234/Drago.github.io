Motivation: Why I created this personal Blog or the whole website? ==> Because when I was in the interview, I realize it’s hard to build a strong trust and understanding between me and the company that is trying to hire me. For company, they want me to show them something that can prove my competence for the job/position, and it's worth for that amount of salary ==> For me(as interviewee), I need to pitch out all those knowledge and experience that are noted in my resume and prove they are valid and genuine, within that 1-2 hours of interview.
为什么我当初创建了这个个人博客或整个网站? ==> 因为当初我在面试的时候，我经常意识到，想要在我和想要雇佣我的公司之间建立牢固的信任和理解是非常困难的一件事。对于公司来说，他们希望你向他们展示一些东西，能证明你有能力胜任这份工作/职位，并且你值得拿那么多薪水。而对于我(作为应聘者)来说，我需要在1-2小时的面试中绞尽脑汁，把简历中提到的所有知识和经验清晰的表达出来。


However, realistically speaking, there are two problems for me. First of all, many details are forgotten 1-2 weeks after the end of the project, and it is difficult to retrieve all the memories within 1-2 days before the interview. Second, the interview often lasts around 1 hours, even I can remember the whole things, it is difficult to explain everything clearly in such a short period of time. Many technical details involve abstract ideas, algorithmic procedures, and mathematical formulas. Moreover, sometimes I don’t know whether I should assume the interviewer knows or understands those concepts or not.
然而，现实地说，我有两个问题。首先，很多细节在项目结束1-2周后就忘记了，而且也很难在面试前1-2天内把记忆都找回来，还要清晰的解释清楚。第二，面试也就1-2个小时，很难在这么短的时间内把所有的东西都讲清楚。很多技术细节都涉及到抽象的想法、算法程序，和数学公式。而且，有时有些概念我也不知道该不该假设面试官是否知道或者了解过。

That’s why, instead of cramming my head with all those details that might or might not being asked during interview, I built this personal blog to relive the burden of head and those unreliable and fragile memory. plus, it makes it easier for interviewer to access my ability, and also make it easier for future me to retrieve the knowledge when I need to.
这就是为什么我没有把面试中可能会问到或可能不会问到的所有细节塞满我的脑袋，而是建立了这个个人博客来重温头脑的负担和那些不可靠且脆弱的记忆。此外，它让面试官更容易了解我的能力，也让我在需要时更容易回复这些知识。

<!-- as a student, there are too many things to worry about in a day (you know, all those academic commitment, taking classes, doing homework, finding research advisors, learning out-of-school skills, building social network, club's leadership responsibility, and some personal life), and there is just not enough time for me to review all those technical details and get all the memory back within that 1-2 days before interview. 



然而，现实地说，对我来说有两个问题。首先，作为一名学生，每天有太多的事情要担心(你知道，所有的学业承诺，上课，做作业，寻找研究顾问，学习校外技能，建立社交网络，俱乐部的领导责任，以及一些个人生活). 尽管说面试都会提前一两天通知，但真正能用来准备的时间也就几个小时。很难有没有足够的时间复习所有的技术细节，并恢复所有的记忆。另外，在做了几周的项目后，很多细节我都不记得了。


Second, sometime I feel it is difficult for me to express the whole things in such a short time and to clearly express the technologies and algorithms I have used. Many technical details are involved with abstract ideas, algorithmic procedure, and mathematical formulas, and I don't know if I should assume they know all those things or not. -->





<!-- Plus, I feel it's a good thing to keep all those technical project details online, to share my wisdom, insight, knowledge and experience with other people, to show some of my past and background, and build some connection or understanding between me and those future friends or colleagues.

= = >这是为什么, 而不是填鸭式的脑袋与所有这些细节可能或不可能被要求在采访中,建立个人博客重温我的负担,保持所有这些在线技术项目细节,分享我的智慧、洞察力,与他人的知识和经验,给一些我的过去和背景,在我和那些未来的朋友或同事之间建立一些联系或理解。 -->


<!-- However, realistically, the problem for me is, as a student, there are too many thing to worry about in a day, and just no enough time for me to prepare those technical details and get all thing work perfectly right within that couple days before interview. You know those academic commitment, such as taking class, doing homework, finding research advisors, learning out-of-class skills. And the school is more than just study, what is real important and can make your different is the school relationship, building social network, taking leadership responsibility, and helping other peoples. (And, I am a human as well,  need some sleep, food too, and some afternoon workout time as well) ==> But, obviously, nobody would care those crap. ==> That’s why, instead of cramming my head with all those details that might or might not being asked during interview, I built this personal blog to relive my burden, to keep all those technical project details online, to share my wisdom, insight, knowledge and experience with other people, to show some of my past and background, and build some connection or understanding between me and those future friends or colleagues. -->

<!-- 然而，现实而言，对我来说，问题是，作为一名学生，一天有太多的事情要担心，只是没有足够的时间让我准备那些技术细节，并在面试前几天把所有事情都做好（尽管说会提前一两天通知你，但能用来准备的时间估计就几个小时，不可能整天都拿去准备面试的）。你知道那些学术承诺，比如上课、做作业、寻找研究顾问、学习课外技能。学校不仅仅是学习，真正重要的和能让你与众不同的是学校关系，建立社会网络，承担领导责任，帮助他人。(而且，我也是人，也需要一些睡眠，食物，以及一些下午的锻炼时间)==>但是，很明显，没有人会在意这些废话。 -->




<!-- As a result, everyone will be happy and better off. This will not only make it easier for interviewer to access my ability, but also make it easier for future me to retrieve the knowledge when I need to.

作为结果，每个人都会很快乐，生活也会更好。这不仅让面试官更容易了解我的能力，也让未来的我更容易在需要的时候检索知识。 -->
