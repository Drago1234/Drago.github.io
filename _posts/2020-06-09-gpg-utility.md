### Abstract: 
GnuPG is a cryptography tool that helps you manage public and private keys as well as perform encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify operations. It is an open-source version of PGP. This tutorial will go over basic key management, encrypting (symmetrically and asymmetrically), decrypting, signing messages, and verifying signatures with GPG.
## Terminology
* cryptography: The process to secure information and make it unreadable without special knowledge or a key. E.g. ATBAH cipher, Caesar Cipher, Cardan grille, 
* Encrytion: aka Cipher, a way/method to hide the information, such that only the one with secrete method(key) can read.
* Ciphertext: The encoded message resulting from an encryption operation
* Plaintext(or cleartext): The message you want to send
* Encipher: To encrypt, encode, or eoncert plaintext into ciphertext.
* Decipher: To decrypt, decode, or conver ciphertext into plaintext.
* Symmetrix encryption: use same key for encryption and decryption, aka private-key encryption. The key that generated by symmetrix encryption called secret
* Asymmetric encryption: Use one key for encryption and one for decryption, aka publick-key encryption.
* Hash algorithms: a public function that create a hash value, or message digest, or fingerprint to confirm the integrity and identity of message.
* steganography: a data hiding method that involves hiding information embedded within other files, such as ppt, pictures.
  



* bit stream method: each bit in the plaintext is transformed into a cipher, one bit at a time, commonly use for XOR operation.
* Block cipher method: the message is divided into blocks(e.g. 8, 16, 32, 64), and then each block of plaintext bits is transformed into an encrypted block of cipher bit, commonly used for substitution, transposition, XOR operation.
* SSL(Secure Sockets Layer): A security protocol developed by Netscape to use public-key encrytption to secure a channel over the internet.

Encryption algorithm:
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): a cipher, a symmetric encryption algorithm, won't succumb to a brute force attack and considered as unbreakeable modern technology, adopted for "Top Secrete" U.S. Gov files, released in 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
* Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric encryption method, a obsolete method but has a stronger variance which known as 3DES, 3DES and AES both considered as unbreakable modern technology but 3DES is not good as AES, and was developed by IBM in the 1970s.

### Q&A

* What tools ar available for File Encryption?
 --> VeraCrypt (OS X, Linux, and Windows), AxCrypt (Windows), BitLocker (Windows), GNU Privacy Guard (OS X, Linux, and Windows)--aka GPG, and 7-Zip (OS X, Linux, and Windows).
