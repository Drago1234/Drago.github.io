* Remember those several line of code when you start to setting up a new environment in the terminal. (Source: <a href="https://codemy.com/git">https://codemy.com/git</a>)

{% highlight c linenos %}
  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  $ git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"
  $ git config --global push.default matching
  $ git config --global alias.co checkout
  $ git init
{% endhighlight %}
